[
  first thing we create is Layout(structuring Layout).
]

[
  React.Fragment is a component which is exported by React.

  allows us to group list of elements or childs without using extra div or node in DOM
]

img:
[
  instead of importing image and using it.

  use this -> <img src={ require('./images/image1.jpg') } />
]

to flex the items
[
  flex-wrap: wrap;  --> makes the items flex properly on screen and then automatically goes to next row.

  we can use grid as well.

Q: Is JSX mandatory for React?
[
  A: JSX is an Extension Syntax that allows writing HTML and Javascript together easily 
  in React and is used to create React elements. These elements are then rendered to the 
  React DOM. Each JSX element is just to make use of React easy and for calling 
  React.createElement(component, props, â€¦children) with less work. So, anything that is 
  done with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript. So JSX is not mandatory but 
  is used for writing better and clean code instead of writing code using React.CreateElement.

Example of JSX
const sample = <h2>Greetings</h2>;
