export default:
[
  you can only export one thing using 'export default _____' and not multiple things.

  you can import by renaming it if you have used default export.

  Default import
  [
    and you can import by this ----> import ______ from "path";
  ]

  and still you want to send multiple export using default ---> then wrap it inside object and send the object.
]

for exporting multiple things:
[
  you can directly export by writing 'export' in front of functions definition.

  you can't rename the name of component while importing if you have used named export.

  Named import
  [
    and you can import by this ----> import { _______ } from "path";
  ]
]

[
  you can use any file(either js or jsx)
